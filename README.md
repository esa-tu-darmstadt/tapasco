System Requirements
-------------------
TaPaSCo is known to work in this environment:

*   Intel x86_64 arch
*   Linux kernel 4.4+
*   Fedora 30+, Ubuntu 16.04+
*   Fedora 24/25 does not support debug mode due to GCC bug
*   Bash Shell 4.2.x+

Other setups likely work as well, but are untested.

Prerequisites for Toolflow
-------------
To use TaPaSCo, you'll need working installations of

*   Vivado Design Suite 2017.4 or newer
*   Java SDK 8 - 11
*   git
*   python
*   GCC newer than 5.x.x for C++11 support
*   *OPTIONAL:* libncurses for the tapasco-debug application
*   *OPTIONAL:* Local Installation of gradle 5.0+, if you do not want to use the included wrapper.

If you want to use the High-Level Synthesis flow for generating custom IP
cores, you will also need:

*   Vivado HLS 2017.4+

Check that at least the following are in your `$PATH`:

*   `vivado` - If not source `path/to/vivado/settings64.sh`
*   `git`
*   `bash`
*   \[`vivado_hls`\] - Since Vivado 2018.1 this is included in `vivado`

When using *Ubuntu*, ensure that the following packages are installed:

* unzip
* zip
* git
* findutils
* curl
* default-jdk

```
apt-get -y install unzip git zip findutils curl default-jdk
```

When using *Fedora*, ensure that the following packages are installed:

* which
* java-openjdk
* findutils

```
dnf -y install which java-openjdk findutils
```


TaPaSCo-Toolflow Setup
----------------------

Using the prebuilt packages, the setup of TaPaSCo is very easy:

1.  Create or open a folder, which you would like to use as your TaPaSCo workspace.
    Within this folder, run the TaPaSCo-Initialization-Script which is located in
    `/opt/tapasco/tapasco-init-toolflow.sh`. This will setup your current folder as `TAPASCO_WORK_DIR`.
    It will also create the file `tapasco-setup.sh` within your current directory. 
2.	Source `tapasco-setup.sh`.

If you want to use a specific (pre-release) version or branch, you can do the following:

1.  Clone TaPaSCo: `git clone https://github.com/esa-tu-darmstadt/tapasco.git`
2.  _Optionally_ Checkout a corresponding branch: `git checkout <BRANCH>`
3.  Create or open a folder, which you would like to use as your TaPaSCo workspace.
    Within this folder, run the TaPaSCo-Initialization-Script `tapasco-init.sh` which is located in the root-folder 
    of your cloned repo. This will setup your current folder as `TAPASCO_WORK_DIR`.
    It will also create the file `tapasco-setup.sh` within your workdir.
4.  Source `tapasco-setup.sh` to setup the TaPaSCo-Environment.
5.  Build the TaPaSCo-Toolflow using `tapasco-build-toolflow`.

Whenever you want to use TaPaSCo in the future, just source the corresponding workspace using the `tapasco-setup.sh`.
This also allows you to have multiple independent TaPaSCo-Workspaces.

Prerequisites for the Runtime
-------------

*Ubuntu*:
```
apt-get -y install build-essential linux-headers-generic python cmake libelf-dev libncurses-dev git rpm
```

*Fedora*:
```
dnf -y install kernel-devel make gcc gcc-c++ elfutils-libelf-devel cmake ncurses-devel python libatomic git rpm-build
```

TaPaSCo-Runtime Setup
---------------------

If you want to use a specific (pre-release) version or branch, you can do the following:

1.  Clone TaPaSCo: `git clone https://github.com/esa-tu-darmstadt/tapasco.git`
2.  _Optionally_ Checkout a corresponding branch: `git checkout <BRANCH>`
3.  Create or open a folder, which you would like to use as your TaPaSCo workspace.
    Within this folder, run the TaPaSCo-Initialization-Script `tapasco-init.sh` which is located in the root-folder 
    of your cloned repo. This will setup your current folder as `TAPASCO_WORK_DIR`.
    It will also create the file `tapasco-setup.sh` within your workdir.
4.  Source `tapasco-setup.sh` to setup the TaPaSCo-Environment.
5.  Build the TaPaSCo-Toolflow using `tapasco-build-libs`.

All of this is not necessary when using the prebuilt packages. In that case, the corresponding libraries and files are installed as usual for your OS.

Getting Started - Build a TaPaSCo design
----------------------------------------
1.  Import your kernels
    *   HDL flow: `tapasco import path/to/ZIP as <ID> -p <PLATFORM>` will import the corresponding ZIP file as a new HDL-based core. The Kernel-ID is set from <ID> and the optional flag `-p <PLATFORM>` determines for which platform the kernel will be available. If it is omitted, it will be made available for all platforms which may take a lot of time.
    *   HLS flow: `tapasco hls <KERNEL> -p <PLATFORM>` will perform hls according to the `kernel.json`. The resulting HLS-based core will be made available for the platform given by `-p <PLATFORM>`. Again, `-p` can be omitted. HLS-Kernels are generally located in `$TAPASCO_WORKDIR/kernel`. If you want to add kernels you can create either symlink or copy them into the folder. Additionally, the folder can be temporarily changed using the optional `--kernelDir path/to/kernels` flag like this: `tapasco --kernelDir path/to/kernels hls <KERNEL> -p <PLATFORM>`
2.  Create a composition: `tapasco compose [<KERNEL> x <COUNT>] @ <NUM> MHz -p <PLATFORM>`
3.  Load the bitstream: `tapasco-load-bitstream <BITSTREAM>`
4.  Implement your host software
    *   C API
    *   C++ API

You can get more information about commands with `tapasco --help` and the corresponding subpages with `tapasco --help <TOPIC>`


Getting Started - Build a Software-Interface
--------------------------------------------
1.  Design your Accelerator using HLS/HDL according to the previous section.
2.  Load your bitstream: `tapasco-load-bitstream my-design.bit --reload-driver`. To do this, you have to source `vivado` and `tapasco-setup.sh`.
3.  Write a C/C++ executable that interfaces with your design accordingly. To get a better understanding of this, you might want to refer to the collection of examples and the corresponding README which is located in `$TAPASCO_HOME/runtime/examples`
4.  Build and Compile your Software.
