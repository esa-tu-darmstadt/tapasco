SFPPLUS in TaPaSCo
===================

A number of platforms in TaPaSCo provide the SFP+-feature which allows to send/recieve network packets.
The following will describe the general configuration format.
The information, which platforms are supported, as well as platform specific information (like the number of available SPF+ Ports),
can be found [here](tapasco-features.md).

## Configuration format

The configuration format is split into three parts:
 1. The [Port Definition](#port-definition)
 2. The [Connections of PEs](#pe-connections) to ports
 3. (Optional) The [Mode](#mode) if the platform supports multiple modes


### Port Definition

Here you can specify a list of ports. Each port has four properties:
 - The name of the port: Used to reference the port when specifiying the connections
 - The mode of the port: How PEs are connected to the port ([singular](#singular-mode), [roundrobin](#roundrobin-mode), [broadcast](#broadcast-mode))
 - The physical port number: Depends on the platform, see [TaPaSCo Features](tapasco-features.md)
 - Where the clock synchronization should occur: Either the synchronization is done via AXI-Stream interconnects (`ic_sync: true`).
   Alternatively the synchronization can be handled by the PE (`ic_sync: false`). In the latter case the PE must have a separate
   clock/reset-pair for each AXI-Stream interface.

Example:

```
SFPPLUS {
  "Ports": [
    {
  	  "name": "port_A",
  	  "mode": "singular",
  	  "physical_port": "0",
  	  "ic_sync": false
  	},
  	{
  	  "name": "port_B",
  	  "mode": "roundrobin",
  	  "physical_port": "1",
  	  "ic_sync": true
  	}
  ],
  ...
}
```

#### Singular Mode

In this mode each Port can only have one sending AXIS-Interface and one recieving AXIS-Interface connected. They are directly connected to the port.

#### Roundrobin Mode

In this mode the packets recieved on the port are distributed to all connected AXIS-Interface round-robin: The first recieved packet is forwarded
to the first AXIS-Interface, the second packet to the second AXIS-Interface and so on...

#### Broadcast Mode

In this mode all recieved packets are forwarded to all connected AXIS-Interfaces.

### PE Connections

Here you first define groups of PEs and then for each group how their AXIS-Interfaces are mapped to the ports.
A group of PE is defined by the ID of the PE-Type and a number. Each PE in your composition may only be used
in one of these groups. Each group defines mappings from their AXIS-Interfaces to ports.
A mapping consists of
 - the name of the interface
 - the direction: `rx` for recieving packets and `tx` for sending packets
 - the port name ([see](#port-definition))

Example:

```
SFPPLUS {
  ...
  "PEs": [
    {
      "ID": "PE1",
      "Count": "1",
      "mappings": [
        {
          "interface": "sfp_axis_0_rx",
          "direction": "rx",
          "port": "port_A"
        },
        {
          "interface": "sfp_axis_0_tx",
          "direction": "tx",
          "port": "port_A"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "ID": "PE2",
      "Count": "4",
      "mappings": [
        {
          "interface": "sfp_axis_0_rx",
          "direction": "rx",
          "port": "port_B"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  ...
}
```


### Mode

Some platforms provide multiple modes. This can be configured by supplying the name of the mode which should be used.
If no mode is given the default mode for this platform is used.

Example:

```
SFPPLUS {
  ...
  "Mode": "100G"
}
```

### Datawidth (Versal only)

The 100G MRMAC on Versal supports different data width modes. 
* `256`: lowest-latency without any clock conversion, 256bit at 644.541 MHz _(default)_
* `384`: 384bit at 390.625 MHz
* `384segmented`: 384bit at 322.265 MHz, segmented mode (see PG314 for details)

Example:

```
SFPPLUS {
  ...
  "Datawidth": "384"
}
```

## 100G (UltraScale+)

The CMAC-IP (100G Ethernet) for Xilinx UltraScale(+) FPGAs has some specialities which need to be respected when using it.
Some of these concern the FPGA itself, others are for the connection partner (switch, nic, ...).
TaPaSCo will automate the FPGA-related specialities to some extent. You need to do the following:
 
 - Configure the link partner: Disable "Auto Negotiation", fix speed to 100G, activate RS-FEC
 - Load Bitstream
 - The CMAC automatically resets and the Ethernet link should come up


The complete procedure as a reference:

 - IP Configuration: Typically you want to configure with "Enable FCS Insertion/Stripping", "RS-FEC", "Check Preamble" and "Check SFD" enabled.
   "Auto Negotiation/Link Training" can also be useful but needs a separate license and is *not* required.
 - The link partner needs to be configured to match these settings (if "Auto Negotiation" is disabled): It is (at least) necessary to also disable "Auto Negotiation", fix the speed to 100G and enable RS-FEC.
 - Depending on the board there may be specific QSFP28-related board pins (Enable, LowPower, Reset, Interrupt, ...) which need to be respected
 - The CMAC-IP has a required startup procedure (which is only partly documented in PG203). All of these steps can be done via the input pins of the IP or via the optional AXI-Lite Interface. These are the steps for the input pins, see PG203 for the AXI-Lite:
   - Enable RS-FEC: Set ctl_rx_rsfec_enable, ctl_tx_rsfec_enable, ctl_rx_rsfec_enable_correction, ctl_rx_rsfec_enable_indication to 0x1
   - Reset the core via core_rx_reset and core_tx_reset
   - Enable RX: ctl_rx_enable = 0x1 and ctl_tx_send_rfi = 0x1
   - Wait for stat_rx_aligned (output of IP core)
   - Enable TX: ctl_tx_send_rfi = 0x0 and ctl_tx_enable = 0x1
 - Sometimes it may be necessary to configure the QSFP28-Transceiver. On the FPGA this is typically possible via I2C. The Transceiver has some status and configuration registers which are specified in SFF-8636. Important registers include
   - Interrupt Flags (Byte 3-5, 9-14)
   - Power Monitoring (Byte 34-57)
   - Control (Byte 86-99)
