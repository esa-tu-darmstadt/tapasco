ALL'S WELL, THAT ENDS WELL

ACTUS PRIMUS. SCOENA PRIMA.

ENTER YONG BERTRAM COUNT OF ROSSILLION, HIS MOTHER, AND HELENA,
LORD
LAFEW, ALL IN BLACKE.

  MOTHER. IN DELIUERING MY SONNE FROM ME, I BURIE A SECOND
HUSBAND

   ROS. AND I IN GOING MADAM, WEEP ORE MY
FATHERS DEATH ANEW; BUT I MUST ATTEND HIS MAIESTIES
COMMAND, TO WHOM I AM NOW IN WARD, EUERMORE
IN SUBIECTION

   LAF. YOU SHALL FIND OF THE KING A HUSBAND MADAME,
YOU SIR A FATHER. HE THAT SO GENERALLY IS AT ALL TIMES GOOD,
MUST OF NECESSITIE HOLD HIS VERTUE TO YOU, WHOSE WORTHINESSE
WOULD STIRRE IT VP WHERE IT WANTED RATHER THEN LACK
IT WHERE THERE IS SUCH ABUNDANCE

   MO. WHAT HOPE IS THERE OF HIS MAIESTIES AMENDMENT?
  LAF. HE HATH ABANDON'D HIS PHISITIONS MADAM, VNDER
WHOSE PRACTISES HE HATH PERSECUTED TIME WITH HOPE,
AND FINDS NO OTHER ADUANTAGE IN THE PROCESSE, BUT ONELY
THE LOOSING OF HOPE BY TIME

   MO. THIS YONG GENTLEWOMAN HAD A FATHER, O THAT
HAD, HOW SAD A PASSAGE TIS, WHOSE SKILL WAS ALMOST AS
GREAT AS HIS HONESTIE, HAD IT STRETCH'D SO FAR, WOULD HAUE
MADE NATURE IMMORTALL, AND DEATH SHOULD HAUE PLAY FOR
LACKE OF WORKE. WOULD FOR THE KINGS SAKE HEE WERE LIUING,
I THINKE IT WOULD BE THE DEATH OF THE KINGS DISEASE

   LAF. HOW CALL'D YOU THE MAN YOU SPEAKE OF MADAM?
  MO. HE WAS FAMOUS SIR IN HIS PROFESSION, AND IT WAS
HIS GREAT RIGHT TO BE SO: GERARD DE NARBON

   LAF. HE WAS EXCELLENT INDEED MADAM, THE KING VERY
LATELIE SPOKE OF HIM ADMIRINGLY, AND MOURNINGLY: HEE
WAS SKILFULL ENOUGH TO HAUE LIU'D STIL, IF KNOWLEDGE COULD
BE SET VP AGAINST MORTALLITIE

   ROS. WHAT IS IT (MY GOOD LORD) THE KING LANGUISHES
OF?
  LAF. A FISTULA MY LORD

   ROS. I HEARD NOT OF IT BEFORE

   LAF. I WOULD IT WERE NOT NOTORIOUS. WAS THIS GENTLEWOMAN
THE DAUGHTER OF GERARD DE NARBON?
  MO. HIS SOLE CHILDE MY LORD, AND BEQUEATHED TO MY
OUER LOOKING. I HAUE THOSE HOPES OF HER GOOD, THAT HER
EDUCATION PROMISES HER DISPOSITIONS SHEE INHERITS, WHICH
MAKES FAIRE GIFTS FAIRER: FOR WHERE AN VNCLEANE MIND CARRIES
VERTUOUS QUALITIES, THERE COMMENDATIONS GO WITH
PITTY, THEY ARE VERTUES AND TRAITORS TOO: IN HER THEY ARE
THE BETTER FOR THEIR SIMPLENESSE; SHE DERIUES HER HONESTIE,
AND ATCHEEUES HER GOODNESSE

   LAFEW. YOUR COMMENDATIONS MADAM GET FROM HER
TEARES

   MO. 'TIS THE BEST BRINE A MAIDEN CAN SEASON HER PRAISE
IN. THE REMEMBRANCE OF HER FATHER NEUER APPROCHES HER
HEART, BUT THE TIRRANY OF HER SORROWES TAKES ALL LIUELIHOOD
FROM HER CHEEKE. NO MORE OF THIS HELENA, GO TOO, NO
MORE LEAST IT BE RATHER THOUGHT YOU AFFECT A SORROW, THEN
TO HAUE-
  HELL. I DOE AFFECT A SORROW INDEED, BUT I HAUE IT TOO

   LAF. MODERATE LAMENTATION IS THE RIGHT OF THE DEAD,
EXCESSIUE GREEFE THE ENEMIE TO THE LIUING

   MO. IF THE LIUING BE ENEMIE TO THE GREEFE, THE EXCESSE
MAKES IT SOONE MORTALL

   ROS. MADDAM I DESIRE YOUR HOLIE WISHES

   LAF. HOW VNDERSTAND WE THAT?
  MO. BE THOU BLEST BERTRAME, AND SUCCEED THY FATHER
IN MANNERS AS IN SHAPE: THY BLOOD AND VERTUE
CONTEND FOR EMPIRE IN THEE, AND THY GOODNESSE
SHARE WITH THY BIRTH-RIGHT. LOUE ALL, TRUST A FEW,
DOE WRONG TO NONE: BE ABLE FOR THINE ENEMIE
RATHER IN POWER THEN VSE: AND KEEPE THY FRIEND
VNDER THY OWNE LIFES KEY. BE CHECKT FOR SILENCE,
BUT NEUER TAX'D FOR SPEECH. WHAT HEAUEN MORE WIL,
THAT THEE MAY FURNISH, AND MY PRAYERS PLUCKE DOWNE,
FALL ON THY HEAD. FARWELL MY LORD,
'TIS AN VNSEASON'D COURTIER, GOOD MY LORD
ADUISE HIM

   LAF. HE CANNOT WANT THE BEST
THAT SHALL ATTEND HIS LOUE

   MO. HEAUEN BLESSE HIM: FARWELL BERTRAM

   RO. THE BEST WISHES THAT CAN BE FORG'D IN YOUR THOGHTS
BE SERUANTS TO YOU: BE COMFORTABLE TO MY MOTHER, YOUR
MISTRIS, AND MAKE MUCH OF HER

   LAF. FAREWELL PRETTIE LADY, YOU MUST HOLD THE CREDIT
OF YOUR FATHER

   HELL. O WERE THAT ALL, I THINKE NOT ON MY FATHER,
AND THESE GREAT TEARES GRACE HIS REMEMBRANCE MORE
THEN THOSE I SHED FOR HIM. WHAT WAS HE LIKE?
I HAUE FORGOTT HIM. MY IMAGINATION
CARRIES NO FAUOUR IN'T BUT BERTRAMS.
I AM VNDONE, THERE IS NO LIUING, NONE,
IF BERTRAM BE AWAY. 'TWERE ALL ONE,
THAT I SHOULD LOUE A BRIGHT PARTICULER STARRE,
AND THINK TO WED IT, HE IS SO ABOUE ME
IN HIS BRIGHT RADIENCE AND COLATERALL LIGHT,
MUST I BE COMFORTED, NOT IN HIS SPHERE;
TH' AMBITION IN MY LOUE THUS PLAGUES IT SELFE:
THE HIND THAT WOULD BE MATED BY THE LION
MUST DIE FOR LOUE. 'TWAS PRETTIE, THOUGH A PLAGUE
TO SEE HIM EUERIE HOURE TO SIT AND DRAW
HIS ARCHED BROWES, HIS HAWKING EIE, HIS CURLES
IN OUR HEARTS TABLE: HEART TOO CAPEABLE
OF EUERIE LINE AND TRICKE OF HIS SWEET FAUOUR.
BUT NOW HE'S GONE, AND MY IDOLATROUS FANCIE
MUST SANCTIFIE HIS RELIQUES. WHO COMES HEERE?
ENTER PARROLLES.

ONE THAT GOES WITH HIM: I LOUE HIM FOR HIS SAKE,
AND YET I KNOW HIM A NOTORIOUS LIAR,
THINKE HIM A GREAT WAY FOOLE, SOLIE A COWARD,
YET THESE FIXT EUILS SIT SO FIT IN HIM,
THAT THEY TAKE PLACE, WHEN VERTUES STEELY BONES
LOOKES BLEAKE I'TH COLD WIND: WITHALL, FULL OFTE WE SEE
COLD WISEDOME WAIGHTING ON SUPERFLUOUS FOLLIE

   PAR. SAUE YOU FAIRE QUEENE

   HEL. AND YOU MONARCH

   PAR. NO

   HEL. AND NO

   PAR. ARE YOU MEDITATING ON VIRGINITIE?
  HEL. I: YOU HAUE SOME STAINE OF SOULDIER IN YOU: LET
MEE ASKE YOU A QUESTION. MAN IS ENEMIE TO VIRGINITIE,
HOW MAY WE BARRACADO IT AGAINST HIM?
  PAR. KEEPE HIM OUT

   HEL. BUT HE ASSAILES, AND OUR VIRGINITIE THOUGH VALIANT,
IN THE DEFENCE YET IS WEAK: VNFOLD TO VS SOME WAR-LIKE
RESISTANCE

   PAR. THERE IS NONE: MAN SETTING DOWNE BEFORE YOU,
WILL VNDERMINE YOU, AND BLOW YOU VP

   HEL. BLESSE OUR POORE VIRGINITY FROM VNDERMINERS
AND BLOWERS VP. IS THERE NO MILITARY POLICY HOW VIRGINS
MIGHT BLOW VP MEN?
  PAR. VIRGINITY BEEING BLOWNE DOWNE, MAN WILL
QUICKLIER BE BLOWNE VP: MARRY IN BLOWING HIM DOWNE
AGAINE, WITH THE BREACH YOUR SELUES MADE, YOU LOSE YOUR
CITTY. IT IS NOT POLITICKE, IN THE COMMON-WEALTH OF
NATURE, TO PRESERUE VIRGINITY. LOSSE OF VIRGINITIE, IS
RATIONALL ENCREASE, AND THERE WAS NEUER VIRGIN GOE, TILL
VIRGINITIE WAS FIRST LOST. THAT YOU WERE MADE OF, IS METTALL
TO MAKE VIRGINS. VIRGINITIE, BY BEEING ONCE LOST,
MAY BE TEN TIMES FOUND: BY BEING EUER KEPT, IT IS EUER
LOST: 'TIS TOO COLD A COMPANION: AWAY WITH'T

   HEL. I WILL STAND FOR'T A LITTLE, THOUGH THEREFORE I DIE
A VIRGIN

   PAR. THERE'S LITTLE CAN BEE SAIDE IN'T, 'TIS AGAINST THE
RULE OF NATURE. TO SPEAKE ON THE PART OF VIRGINITIE, IS
TO ACCUSE YOUR MOTHERS; WHICH IS MOST INFALLIBLE DISOBEDIENCE.
HE THAT HANGS HIMSELFE IS A VIRGIN: VIRGINITIE
MURTHERS IT SELFE, AND SHOULD BE BURIED IN HIGHWAYES
OUT OF ALL SANCTIFIED LIMIT, AS A DESPERATE OFFENDRESSE AGAINST
NATURE. VIRGINITIE BREEDES MITES, MUCH LIKE A
CHEESE, CONSUMES IT SELFE TO THE VERY PAYRING, AND SO
DIES WITH FEEDING HIS OWNE STOMACKE. BESIDES, VIRGINITIE
IS PEEUISH, PROUD, YDLE, MADE OF SELFE-LOUE, WHICH
IS THE MOST INHIBITED SINNE IN THE CANNON. KEEPE IT NOT,
YOU CANNOT CHOOSE BUT LOOSE BY'T. OUT WITH'T: WITHIN
TEN YEARE IT WILL MAKE IT SELFE TWO, WHICH IS A GOODLY INCREASE,
AND THE PRINCIPALL IT SELFE NOT MUCH THE WORSE.
AWAY WITH'T

   HEL. HOW MIGHT ONE DO SIR, TO LOOSE IT TO HER OWNE
LIKING?
  PAR. LET MEE SEE. MARRY ILL, TO LIKE HIM THAT NE'RE
IT LIKES. 'TIS A COMMODITY WIL LOSE THE GLOSSE WITH LYING:
THE LONGER KEPT, THE LESSE WORTH: OFF WITH'T WHILE 'TIS
VENDIBLE. ANSWER THE TIME OF REQUEST, VIRGINITIE LIKE
AN OLDE COURTIER, WEARES HER CAP OUT OF FASHION, RICHLY
SUTED, BUT VNSUTEABLE, IUST LIKE THE BROOCH & THE TOOTH-PICK,
WHICH WERE NOT NOW: YOUR DATE IS BETTER IN YOUR
PYE AND YOUR PORREDGE, THEN IN YOUR CHEEKE: AND YOUR
VIRGINITY, YOUR OLD VIRGINITY, IS LIKE ONE OF OUR FRENCH
WITHER'D PEARES, IT LOOKES ILL, IT EATES DRILY, MARRY 'TIS A
WITHER'D PEARE: IT WAS FORMERLY BETTER, MARRY YET 'TIS A
WITHER'D PEARE: WILL YOU ANY THING WITH IT?
  HEL. NOT MY VIRGINITY YET:
THERE SHALL YOUR MASTER HAUE A THOUSAND LOUES,
A MOTHER, AND A MISTRESSE, AND A FRIEND,
A PHENIX, CAPTAINE, AND AN ENEMY,
A GUIDE, A GODDESSE, AND A SOUERAIGNE,
A COUNSELLOR, A TRAITORESSE, AND A DEARE:
HIS HUMBLE AMBITION, PROUD HUMILITY:
HIS IARRING, CONCORD: AND HIS DISCORD, DULCET:
HIS FAITH, HIS SWEET DISASTER: WITH A WORLD
OF PRETTY FOND ADOPTIOUS CHRISTENDOMES
THAT BLINKING CUPID GOSSIPS. NOW SHALL HE:
I KNOW NOT WHAT HE SHALL, GOD SEND HIM WELL,
THE COURTS A LEARNING PLACE, AND HE IS ONE

   PAR. WHAT ONE IFAITH?
  HEL. THAT I WISH WELL, 'TIS PITTY

   PAR. WHAT'S PITTY?
  HEL. THAT WISHING WELL HAD NOT A BODY IN'T,
WHICH MIGHT BE FELT, THAT WE THE POORER BORNE,
WHOSE BASER STARRES DO SHUT VS VP IN WISHES,
MIGHT WITH EFFECTS OF THEM FOLLOW OUR FRIENDS,
AND SHEW WHAT WE ALONE MUST THINKE, WHICH NEUER
RETURNES VS THANKES.

  HEL. YOU GO SO MUCH BACKWARD WHEN YOU FIGHT

   PAR. THAT'S FOR ADUANTAGE

   HEL. SO IS RUNNING AWAY,

WHAT ADUICE SHALL THRUST VPPON THEE, ELSE THOU
DIEST IN THINE VNTHANKFULNES, AND THINE IGNORANCE MAKES
THEE AWAY, FAREWELL: WHEN THOU HAST LEYSURE, SAY THY
PRAIERS: WHEN THOU HAST NONE, REMEMBER THY FRIENDS:
GET THEE A GOOD HUSBAND, AND VSE HIM AS HE VSES THEE:
SO FAREWELL

   HEL. OUR REMEDIES OFT IN OUR SELUES DO LYE,
WHICH WE ASCRIBE TO HEAUEN: THE FATED SKYE
GIUES VS FREE SCOPE, ONELY DOTH BACKWARD PULL
OUR SLOW DESIGNES, WHEN WE OUR SELUES ARE DULL.
WHAT POWER IS IT, WHICH MOUNTS MY LOUE SO HYE,
THAT MAKES ME SEE, AND CANNOT FEEDE MINE EYE?
THE MIGHTIEST SPACE IN FORTUNE, NATURE BRINGS
TO IOYNE LIKE, LIKES; AND KISSE LIKE NATIUE THINGS.
IMPOSSIBLE BE STRANGE ATTEMPTS TO THOSE
THAT WEIGH THEIR PAINES IN SENCE, AND DO SUPPOSE
WHAT HATH BEENE, CANNOT BE. WHO EUER STROUE
TO SHEW HER MERIT, THAT DID MISSE HER LOUE?

TILL THEIR OWNE SCORNE RETURNE TO THEM VNNOTED
ERE THEY CAN HIDE THEIR LEUITIE IN HONOUR:

HIS EQUALL HAD AWAK'D THEM, AND HIS HONOUR
CLOCKE TO IT SELFE, KNEW THE TRUE MINUTE WHEN

MAKING THEM PROUD OF HIS HUMILITIE,
IN THEIR POORE PRAISE HE HUMBLED: SUCH A MAN

OF YONGER SPIRITS, WHOSE APPREHENSIUE SENSES
ALL BUT NEW THINGS DISDAINE; WHOSE IUDGEMENTS ARE
MEERE FATHERS OF THEIR GARMENTS: WHOSE CONSTANCIES

TERRIBLE SHEWES IN THE WRACKE OF MAIDEN-HOOD, CANNOT
FOR ALL THAT DISSWADE SUCCESSION, BUT THAT THEY ARE LIMED

A SHREWD TURNE IF SHE PLEAS'D

   HEL. HOW DO YOU MEANE?
MAY BE THE AMOROUS COUNT SOLICITES HER
IN THE VNLAWFULL PURPOSE

   WID. HE DOES INDEEDE,

OWNER OF NO ONE GOOD QUALITIE, WORTHY YOUR LORDSHIPS
ENTERTAINMENT

   CAP.G. IT WERE FIT YOU KNEW HIM, LEAST REPOSING TOO
FARRE IN HIS VERTUE WHICH HE HATH NOT, HE MIGHT AT SOME
GREAT AND TRUSTIE BUSINESSE, IN A MAINE DAUNGER, FAYLE

   BER. I WOULD I KNEW IN WHAT PARTICULAR ACTION TO TRY

   CAP.G. NONE BETTER THEN TO LET HIM FETCH OFF HIS
DRUMME, WHICH YOU HEARE HIM SO CONFIDENTLY VNDERTAKE
TO DO

   C.E. I WITH A TROOP OF FLORENTINES WIL SODAINLY SURPRIZE

OUR HORSE VPON OUR OWNE WINGS, AND TO REND OUR OWNE
SOULDIERS

COMMAND

   BER. WELL, WEE CANNOT GREATLY CONDEMNE OUR SUCCESSE:
SOME DISHONOR WEE HAD IN THE LOSSE OF THAT DRUM,

INSTRUMENT OF HONOUR AGAINE INTO HIS NATIUE QUARTER, BE
MAGNANIMIOUS IN THE ENTERPRIZE AND GO ON, I WIL GRACE
THE ATTEMPT FOR A WORTHY EXPLOIT: IF YOU SPEEDE WELL IN

VNDERTAKE THIS BUSINESSE, WHICH HE KNOWES IS NOT TO BE
DONE, DAMNES HIMSELFE TO DO, & DARES BETTER BE DAMND
THEN TO DOO'T

   CAP.G. YOU DO NOT KNOW HIM MY LORD AS WE DOE,
CERTAINE IT IS THAT HE WILL STEALE HIMSELFE INTO A MANS FAUOUR,
AND FOR A WEEKE ESCAPE A GREAT DEALE OF DISCOUERIES,
BUT WHEN YOU FINDE HIM OUT, YOU HAUE HIM EUER AFTER

   BER. WHY DO YOU THINKE HE WILL MAKE NO DEEDE AT

TOKENS AND LETTERS, WHICH SHE DID RESEND,
AND THIS IS ALL I HAUE DONE: SHE'S A FAIRE CREATURE,

IN ANY STAINING ACT

   HEL. NOR WOULD I WISH YOU.
FIRST GIUE ME TRUST, THE COUNT HE IS MY HUSBAND,

Y'ARE GREAT IN FORTUNE

   HEL. TAKE THIS PURSE OF GOLD,
AND LET ME BUY YOUR FRIENDLY HELPE THUS FARRE,
WHICH I WILL OUER-PAY, AND PAY AGAINE
WHEN I HAUE FOUND IT. THE COUNT HE WOES YOUR
DAUGHTER,
LAYES DOWNE HIS WANTON SIEDGE BEFORE HER BEAUTIE,
RESOLUE TO CARRIE HER: LET HER IN FINE CONSENT
AS WEE'L DIRECT HER HOW 'TIS BEST TO BEARE IT:

THAT SHEE'L DEMAND: A RING THE COUNTIE WEARES,
THAT DOWNWARD HATH SUCCEEDED IN HIS HOUSE
FROM SONNE TO SONNE, SOME FOURE OR FIUE DISCENTS,
SINCE THE FIRST FATHER WORE IT. THIS RING HE HOLDS
IN MOST RICH CHOICE: YET IN HIS IDLE FIRE,
TO BUY HIS WILL, IT WOULD NOT SEEME TOO DEERE,
HOW ERE REPENTED AFTER

   WID. NOW I SEE THE BOTTOME OF YOUR PURPOSE

BUT THAT YOUR DAUGHTER ERE SHE SEEMES AS WONNE,
DESIRES THIS RING; APPOINTS HIM AN ENCOUNTER;

TO MARRY HER, ILE ADDE THREE THOUSAND CROWNES
TO WHAT IS PAST ALREADY

   WID. I HAUE YEELDED:
INSTRUCT MY DAUGHTER HOW SHE SHALL PERSEUER,
THAT TIME AND PLACE WITH THIS DECEITE SO LAWFULL
MAY PROUE COHERENT. EUERY NIGHT HE COMES
WITH MUSICKES OF ALL SORTS, AND SONGS COMPOS'D
TO HER VNWORTHINESSE: IT NOTHING STEEDS VS
TO CHIDE HIM FROM OUR EEUES, FOR HE PERSISTS
AS IF HIS LIFE LAY ON'T

   HEL. WHY THEN TO NIGHT
LET VS ASSAY OUR PLOT, WHICH IF IT SPEED,
IS WICKED MEANING IN A LAWFULL DEEDE;
AND LAWFULL MEANING IN A LAWFULL ACT,
WHERE BOTH NOT SINNE, AND YET A SINFULL FACT.
BUT LET'S ABOUT IT.

ACTUS QUARTUS.

   1.SOL. E'N SUCH AS YOU SPEAKE TO ME

   LO.E. HE MUST THINKE VS SOME BAND OF STRANGERS, I'TH
ADUERSARIES ENTERTAINMENT. NOW HE HATH A SMACKE OF ALL
NEIGHBOURING LANGUAGES: THEREFORE WE MUST EUERY ONE
BE A MAN OF HIS OWNE FANCIE, NOT TO KNOW WHAT WE SPEAK
ONE TO ANOTHER: SO WE SEEME TO KNOW, IS TO KNOW STRAIGHT
OUR PURPOSE: CHOUGHS LANGUAGE, GABBLE ENOUGH, AND
GOOD ENOUGH. AS FOR YOU INTERPRETER, YOU MUST SEEME
VERY POLITICKE. BUT COUCH HOA, HEERE HEE COMES, TO BEGUILE
TWO HOURES IN A SLEEPE, AND THEN TO RETURNE & SWEAR
THE LIES HE FORGES.
ENTER PARROLLES.

  PAR. TEN A CLOCKE: WITHIN THESE THREE HOURES 'TWILL
BE TIME ENOUGH TO GOE HOME. WHAT SHALL I SAY I HAUE

LATE, KNOCK'D TOO OFTEN AT MY DOORE: I FINDE MY TONGUE
IS TOO FOOLE-HARDIE, BUT MY HEART HATH THE FEARE OF MARS
BEFORE IT, AND OF HIS CREATURES, NOT DARING THE REPORTS OF
MY TONGUE

   LO.E. THIS IS THE FIRST TRUTH THAT ERE THINE OWN TONGUE
WAS GUILTIE OF

   PAR. WHAT THE DIUELL SHOULD MOUE MEE TO VNDERTAKE
THE RECOUERIE OF THIS DRUMME, BEING NOT IGNORANT OF THE
IMPOSSIBILITY, AND KNOWING I HAD NO SUCH PURPOSE? I
MUST GIUE MY SELFE SOME HURTS, AND SAY I GOT THEM IN EXPLOIT:
YET SLIGHT ONES WILL NOT CARRIE IT. THEY WILL SAY,
CAME YOU OFF WITH SO LITTLE? AND GREAT ONES I DARE NOT
GIUE, WHEREFORE WHAT'S THE INSTANCE. TONGUE, I MUST PUT
YOU INTO A BUTTER-WOMANS MOUTH, AND BUY MY SELFE ANOTHER
OF BAIAZETHS MULE, IF YOU PRATTLE MEE INTO THESE
PERILLES

   LO.E. IS IT POSSIBLE HE SHOULD KNOW WHAT HEE IS, AND
BE THAT HE IS

   PAR. I WOULD THE CUTTING OF MY GARMENTS WOLD SERUE
THE TURNE, OR THE BREAKING OF MY SPANISH SWORD

   LO.E. WE CANNOT AFFOORD YOU SO

   PAR. OR THE BARING OF MY BEARD, AND TO SAY IT WAS IN
STRATAGEM

   LO.E. 'TWOULD NOT DO

   PAR. OR TO DROWNE MY CLOATHES, AND SAY I WAS STRIPT

   LO.E. HARDLY SERUE

   PAR. THOUGH I SWORE I LEAPT FROM THE WINDOW OF THE

   LO.E. HOW DEEPE?
  PAR. THIRTY FADOME

   LO.E. THREE GREAT OATHES WOULD SCARSE MAKE THAT BE

WHOSE BEAUTY DID ASTONISH THE SURUEY

HUMBLY CALL'D MISTRIS

  BER. ADMIRINGLY MY LIEGE, AT FIRST
I STUCKE MY CHOICE VPON HER, ERE MY HEART

WHICH WARPT THE LINE, OF EUERIE OTHER FAUOUR,
SCORN'D A FAIRE COLOUR, OR EXPREST IT STOLNE,
EXTENDED OR CONTRACTED ALL PROPORTIONS
TO A MOST HIDEOUS OBIECT. THENCE IT CAME,
THAT SHE WHOM ALL MEN PRAIS'D, AND WHOM MY SELFE,
SINCE I HAUE LOST, HAUE LOU'D; WAS IN MINE EYE
THE DUST THAT DID OFFEND IT

   KIN. WELL EXCUS'D:
THAT THOU DIDST LOUE HER, STRIKES SOME SCORES AWAY
FROM THE GREAT COMPT: BUT LOUE THAT COMES TOO LATE,
LIKE A REMORSEFULL PARDON SLOWLY CARRIED
TO THE GREAT SENDER, TURNES A SOWRE OFFENCE,
CRYING, THAT'S GOOD THAT'S GONE: OUR RASH FAULTS,
MAKE TRIUIALL PRICE OF SERIOUS THINGS WE HAUE,
NOT KNOWING THEM, VNTILL WE KNOW THEIR GRAUE.
OFT OUR DISPLEASURES TO OUR SELUES VNIUST,
DESTROY OUR FRIENDS, AND AFTER WEEPE THEIR DUST:
OUR OWNE LOUE WAKING, CRIES TO SEE WHAT'S DONE,
WHILE SHAMEFULL HATE SLEEPES OUT THE AFTERNOONE.
BE THIS SWEET HELENS KNELL, AND NOW FORGET HER.
SEND FORTH YOUR AMOROUS TOKEN FOR FAIRE MAUDLIN,

OF HER THAT THREW IT: NOBLE SHE WAS, AND THOUGHT
I STOOD INGAG'D, BUT WHEN I HAD SUBSCRIB'D
TO MINE OWNE FORTUNE, AND INFORM'D HER FULLY,
I COULD NOT ANSWER IN THAT COURSE OF HONOUR
AS SHE HAD MADE THE OUERTURE, SHE CEAST
IN HEAUIE SATISFACTION, AND WOULD NEUER
RECEIUE THE RING AGAINE

YOU GOT IT FROM HER. SHE CALL'D THE SAINTS TO SURETIE,

VNLESSE SHE GAUE IT TO YOUR SELFE IN BED,
WHERE YOU HAUE NEUER COME: OR SENT IT VS
VPON HER GREAT DISASTER

   BER. SHE NEUER SAW IT

   KIN. THOU SPEAK'ST IT FALSELY: AS I LOUE MINE HONOR,
AND MAK'ST CONNECTURALL FEARES TO COME INTO ME,
WHICH I WOULD FAINE SHUT OUT, IF IT SHOULD PROUE
THAT THOU ART SO INHUMANE, 'TWILL NOT PROUE SO:
AND YET I KNOW NOT, THOU DIDST HATE HER DEADLY,
AND SHE IS DEAD, WHICH NOTHING BUT TO CLOSE
HER EYES MY SELFE, COULD WIN ME TO BELEEUE,
MORE THEN TO SEE THIS RING. TAKE HIM AWAY,
MY FORE-PAST PROOFES, HOW ERE THE MATTER FALL
SHALL TAZE MY FEARES OF LITTLE VANITIE,
HAUING VAINLY FEAR'D TOO LITTLE. AWAY WITH HIM,
WEE'L SIFT THIS MATTER FURTHER
